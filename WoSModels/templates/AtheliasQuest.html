  <h1>Athelias Quest Index</h1>

  <p>
    Athelias is a large world, very large. The world really starts at level 99. Of course, there are many things to do during his leveling (just check the class quests to be convinced), but most of the quests that will be added during the development of the world will be level 99 quests. There are three major sets of level 99 quests, each time to get a part of the main level 99 equipment. These quests are marked in red in the list. They take place in different parts of the world: Athelias Island for the weapons, the Desertic Lands for the rings and amulets, and the Old World for the armour (not implanted yet). When a character has completed the main quest of the part of the world he is born in, he is able to travel to a new part. A character born in Athelias Island who has completed the Dark Paladins and Teredroz Invasion quests for example could travel to the Desertic Lands and continue his journey there. The other level 99 quests are not mandatory but will give you some nice rewards - I let you check the level 99 quests section to discover them.
  </p>

  <p>
    <i><b>What are the class quests?</b></i> Every class has a unique quest, divided in three or four parts. Traditionally, it starts in the Academy or Training Ground reserved to the specific class, most likely at level 25. These quests are all unique, and each time you train a char you discover a new part of the story of Athelias. This is also the way to get the spells or skills reserved to the class picked. You must have achieved your class training and completed these quests to start the main level 99 quests.
  </p>

  <p>
    <i><b>What about the other low level quests?</b></i> Most of these quests give you a magical piece of equipment, generally with a boot-effect (double-speed, repeal enemies...). These quests are simple and generally quickly completed, so hopefully you won't get bored when you will train your tenth char and could complete most of them without breaking your leveling.
  </p>

  <p>
    <i><b>What are the random events?</b></i> Most of the random events are still to implant. There are two kinds of random events : in a city and outside. Most of the fights are replaced by random events in a city (however you will sometimes be attacked by a robber, so be careful!), either a merchant selling some stuff or an encounter with a NPC. Anywhere else, the main random events are fights with large groups of monsters. There is a 50% or 60% probability that they drop a rare item after the fight. On the main leveling map, it will be a ring or an amulet (note: amulets and rings cannot be bought in shops). Otherwise, you will encounter a NPC as well.
  </p>

  <p>
    <i><b>Should I be in a team to complete a quest?</b></i> The low-level quests are designed to be soloed by most of the classes. The last part of the class quests might require some help but generally you can solo everything. As of version 1.24, Athelias includes a unique feature in Well of Souls: mercenaries. Mercenaries are NPC that can be hired in taverns at level 99 and fight with you. The idea is simple: if a quest normally requires 6 players, then you can solo it and have up to 5 mercenaries fighting with you. If there are 2 other players in the team for example, then only 3 mercenaries will fight. Of course, you can choose to have only 2 mercenaries fighting for instance.
  </p>

  <p>
    Here is a partial list of the quests of Athelias. All the quests are not listed: none of the class quests appear in the list, nor many other quests. I will probably add them the next time I'll update the site.

        <p><b>Quest :</b> The nine dark paladins are awaken and are about to launch a second invasion over Athelias. Find Tenisan, the grand priest of the old, kept prisoner of an eternal sleep in Varanas Castle and seek his advice. You will have to penetrate the forgotten city of Arkhangalsk to make fail the ritual the chaos sorcerer are about to accomplish, and kill the nine dark paladins.</p>
        <div class="tip">
          Mad's tip: This quest is tough - very tough if you try to solo it. It is possible : I've just done it again, but be prepared to die. In my mind, the best combination of mercenaries for those quests consists in 1 healer, 1 priest (you will definitely need two life monsters, trust me, even when Tenisan will join you), 1 rodeur (good attack and some healing skills), 1 death dancer, and 1 barbarian (or 1 death dancer and 1 paladin : remember that palis can heal a couple of times as well). Priests and healers are probably the best classes to solo this quest. They can rebuff the mercenaries and heal them. Warriors are good as well as they can strike hard and focus on the most dangerous monsters : the life rider for the second part, the elementalists/summoners for the last one. If you are on an illusionist, use the charm /all spell I let you have to turn the summons into allied creatures for the last part. If by chance you have a life pet, I don't suggest you to call it out at the beginning of the battle : do not risk it to die ; call it only to heal/rebuff you or when you're about to die so it can rez you (assuming you have a GS of course, but you have one, right?!). If you die or if your mercenaries are poisoned (a couple of monsters can cast poison /all) then you can run : the fight is 99% lost. Oh, and one more thing : have fun, I'm sure you will love the challenge!

        <p><b>Starting Point :</b> Bag Maker, The Long Way (desert).</p>
        <p><b>Reward :</b> A huge 150 slots trophy bag - you won't get a larger one!</p>
        <p><b>Quest :</b> Find 5 Hill Giants bags. Those trophies can only be found during the quest around Armenis. Most likely, you will not get 5 bags after having completed this quest, and will need to do it again in the team of someone who never did it.</p>
